Abacus
======

A calculator that calculates while you type.

Let's start with a few examples. Just type these in the running window.

    1 + 1
    x = 5
    9 * x
    
    height = 10
    width = 25
    height * width

    1 / x

All these lines above will give you some kind of answer in the right 
pane of the window. Try it and you will get the idea.

If something doesn't work which you expected to, then leave an issue in the
GitHub bug tracker.
